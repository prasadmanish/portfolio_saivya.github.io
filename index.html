		           <h5>What does the future hold? Would our species survive and thrive the same way it did a 100 years ago? What are the ethical and philosophical dilemmas of technology? The geometry of belief gives insight on some of these questions, while providing information on the recent breakthroughs in the tech industry and how it impacts our collective belief and value system.

					The book is divided into multiple chapters about innovations in the past century. Each chapter also provides information about past developments in the technological field, current trends, and what one might expect in the near future. Each section also provides basic, adequate information about the topic for people who may be unfamiliar with it.
					
					All the sections of the book tie into the general idea about how the collective belief structure of humanity has changed throughout the course of history, and how it would further change when new technological disruptions, or major events in human history occur.  </h4>
